# Requirements
Implement a SPA (Single Page Application) which fetches the JSON data on load, and contains at least the following screens:
- the Home screen.
- Either the single author screen or the single category screen.
- One of the creation screens (Add new book, author, category).
- Edit mode with at least one of the edit screens (book, or author or category).

# Optional preferables
- Complete implementation of the wireframes. completing the task is not required. we just need to see enough to get an indicator of your thought process and how you organize things.
- Sorting: implement sorting for book listings by name and/or year published.
- Pagination. All book listings can be paginated with a specific number of items per page. e.g. 5
- Testing (either unit or functional).
- Search feature: Adding the ability to search for books by name, author, or ISBN.

# Notes
- You are free to use any library/framework. however React is highly preferred.
- The provided mock-ups are low fidelity wireframes. Good visual look and appearance is a nice to have. but has no weight in the judgement criteria. you are free to use any UI library or rollout you own styling.
- You can use the [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) package to generate unique IDs when adding new book, author or category.
